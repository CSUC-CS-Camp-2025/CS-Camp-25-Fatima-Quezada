<h1>Wolf Spider</h1>
<p>The <u>wolf spider</u> Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae (from Ancient Greek λύκος (lúkos) 'wolf'), 
  <br>named for their robust and agile hunting skills and excellent eyesight. They live mostly in solitude, hunt alone, 
  <br>and usually do not spin webs. Some are opportunistic hunters, pouncing upon prey as they find it or chasing it over 
  <br>short distances; others wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow. - <src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_spider"text= Wikipedia></src> </p>
